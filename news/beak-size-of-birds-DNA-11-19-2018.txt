**Are the size of beaks of a bird, controlled in a Gene/DNA?**

And Smith knew there was a connection between food and beaks. Big-beaked finches tend to eat larger seeds, while small-beaked finches eat smaller seeds. (No shocker there.)
The mystery was in the DNA. Smith had no idea what genes created these beaks sizes. So he brought in an unexpected ally: Bridgett vonHoldt, a Princeton biologist who studies dogs and wolves, not birds. When she compared small-beaked finch DNA to large-beaked finch DNA, she noticed one spot where the genes were different: a set of 300,000 base pairs. Right in the middle of that chunk was something that she saw in dogs: gene IGF-1.

Depending on where you find it in the DNA, it can make an animal's body part bigger, or it can make the whole animal bigger.

"If this gene is expressed more, you expect a larger trait: a larger body, a larger foot, a larger ear, whatever it is controlling. It then is easy to imagine that with a small change to this gene, traits could very easily change in size or shape. We suspect this is the story here, with these beaks," vonHoldt said.

So the same gene that can give a finch a large beak can make a Doberman fit in your purse. It's almost like animals are stories written with different combinations of the same sentences. And thanks to DNA, we already know the sentences are written with the same letters. We're all made of the same stuff.
