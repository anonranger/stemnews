**Circadian Clock and Time restricted diet**

There is a body of research around your body's Circadian Clock based restricted fasting diet and their health benefits.Scientists are starting to uncover the links between our circadian clocks (the internal program that mediates daily rhythms) and health.

In the process of exploring how the liver’s daily cycles work, Panda found that mice which eat within a set amount of time (8-12 hours) resulted in slimmer, healthier mice than those who ate the same number of calories in a larger window of time, showing that when one eats may be as important as what one eats. If the benefits of this “time-restricted eating“ (TRE) hold true in humans, it could have profound impacts on treating overeating disorders, diabetes and obesity.

Panda’s lab discovered that confining caloric consumption to an 8- to 12-hour period–as people did just a century ago– might stave off high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. He is exploring whether the benefits of time-restricted eating apply to humans as well as mice.
