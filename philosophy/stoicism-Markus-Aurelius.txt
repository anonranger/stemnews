1. Self-Discipline starts with finding your purpose in life. If you have a purpose, you are more likely to complete the tasks. Execute on your goal in small milestones. There is a career purpose and a humanitarian purpose to life. All life is one and inter connected.

2.Count on yourself - Be moderate with desires and do not waste time in frivolous activities as life is short. 

3. Show up everyday and put in your day's effort. No one can stop you. Demonstrate habit of consistency.

4. Practice Vountary hardship to be prepared for a bad event.

5. Dichotomy of control - You cannot control what is outside your will. So do not worry over things you cannot control.

6. Never play the victim - do your job without whining. Whining is an excuse to staying as you are, without striving to get better.

7. Practice delayed gratification - Be patient and wait to get what you want.

8. Ignore Naysayers 

9. Find wise people to idolize. Use their experience to discipline yourself.

10. Review your day. The characteristics of a rational soul are self awareness, self examination and self determination
